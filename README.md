https://nmclear.github.io/GIF_Me_Blazer/

Let's get down to GIF-ness

### How it works:
* There are a few preselected categories of funny TV shows.
* Click on one of the show names to display 10 GIFs.
* Click on a GIF to have it play, click again to pause.
* If you want a larger selection, click on the 'more' button and then click on the category you'd like to see.

#### Any Advice?
* I hope you enjoyed the game! What was your record?
* Feel free to reach out! I would greatly appreciate any tips or feedback on the  visuals or code.

##### Cheers! Keep Coding On!
